## tips:These files need to be opened with Jupyter Notebook.
## step 0,download and place the 31 channel MAT file of ICVL database into “F:/IDM download” folder
## step 1,run "step 1, 213 ICVL dataset to pixel set.ipynb"，a DO set will be generated in "ICVL-pixel数据" folder
## step 2,run "step 2,DO to W.ipynb",a W set named "no_selected_pixel_W_onlyICVL.mat" will be generate in "ICVL-pixel数据" folder
## step 3,run "step 3,the design of net and training.ipynb",new net will be trained and a folder will be generated in path:"nets/hybnet/n+BEST-Fs_CinCCD/"
## step 4,run "step 4,the result of net with the limitation of T.ipynb",trained net will be loaded,presenting the result of restruction and the T of filters.
